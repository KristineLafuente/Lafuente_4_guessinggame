Formative Essay Project - Kristine Lafuente

By  using  methods,  my  code  creates  an  image.  My  art  is  cool  because  I  used  methods  to  make  colorful  shapes  that  create  an  image.  It  is  different  from  the  previous  art  project  because  I  did  not  just  make  random  placed  shapes.  Instead,  I  made  an  image  with  the  shapes.  Because  I  am  new  to  computer  science,  I  know  that  my  art  is  definitely  not  as  advanced  as  some  of  my  classmates,  but  this  project  is  giving  me  experience  that  will  be  useful  in  future  projects  for  this  class.  My  art  follows  the  design  principles  of   encapsulation  by  using  many  methods  that  form  different  shapes.  These  shapes  come  together  as  one  component  to  form  a  single  picture.  
The  class  we  used  is  GraphicsContext,  and  it  is  used  in  the  methods  I  created.  Here  are  my  methods:
The  first  three  methods  make  three  circles  of  different  shapes,  colors,  and  positions.  The  number  values  for  ovals  like  gc.fillOval(70, 110, 100, 100);  form  how  wide  and  long  the  oval  is.  The  numbers  also  determine  where  on  the  canvas  the  ovals  will  be  positioned.  The  methods  typed  like  gc.setFill(Color.HOTPINK);  give  color  to  the  shapes  made.  The  fourth  and  fifth  methods  create  rectangles.  The  numbers  following  the  method  to  make  a  rectangle  are  there  for  sizing  and  positioning  the  quadrilateral.  Before  every  method  that  I  typed  shown  above,  I  used  the  modifier  “private”  and  the  return  “void”.  With  these  four  methods,  I  managed  to  make  a  two  scoop  ice  cream  cone  with  a  cherry  on  top.  I  named  each  shape  in  my  methods  Strawberry,  Mint,  Cherry,  Cone,  and  Rect  to  represent  parts  of  my  image.    
Here  is  my  art:        
I   created  an  ice  cream  cone.  I  have  never  imagined  myself  making  an  image  on  a  computer  using  code.  Now  that  I  have  made  an  image  on  my  own,  I  only  want  to  keep  getting  better  and  get  more  experience.  By  the  end  of  the  school  year,  I  want  to  gain  more  knowledge  about  computer  science,  and  create  a  more  advanced  image.
