The three guiding rules/ principles for this class are tinkerin, knowing how to problem solve, and brainstorming. The problem soliving process has five steps. 1.) define the problem 2.) generate solutions 3.) decide the course of action 4.) implement the solution 5.) evaluate the solution. We have to know what to do next if we run into a problem, and that is what the problem solving process helps us with.
